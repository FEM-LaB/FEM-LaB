- 👋 Hi, I am Houssem REZGUI, a post-doctoral researcher in physics.  
- 👀 I’m interested in the following topics: (1) Boltzmann transport theory, (2) nonequilibrium thermodynamics, and (3) Semiconductor Devices and (4) finite element method.
 Keywords: (1) Nanoscale thermal transport, (2) Phonon hydrodynamics; (3) Electron-Phonon coupling, Emerging nanoelectronics, 2D materials.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects including first-principles Calculation of phonons and electrons properties in 2D materials. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... houssemrezgui30@gmail.com
